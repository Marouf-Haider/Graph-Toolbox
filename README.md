# Graph Visualizer

A Python application for visualizing mathematical functions in 2D (with planned support for 3D, parametric, and complex graphs). Built with CustomTkinter for a nice, responsive UI.

---

## Features
- **2D Function Plotting:** Input and visualize mathematical functions interactively.
- **Custom Themes:** Light/dark mode and custom color themes.
- **Function Management:** Add, select, and remove functions easily.
- **Save Graphs:** Export plots as PNG, JPG, PDF, or SVG.
- **Extensible UI:** Modular design for adding new graph types.
- **Modern Look:** Uses CustomTkinter and custom icons.
